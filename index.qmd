Hi there!

I'm **Jialu (Jayleen) Jiang**, a mathematics major at Mount Holyoke College with a passion for **applied mathematics**, **neural network**, and **disease modeling**. I love building bridges between data and theory, whether through simulating infectious disease dynamics, working with real-world social network data, or diving into PDEs and optimization problems.

Currently, I'm involved in multiple research projects ranging from COVID-19 modeling to EEG-based speech analysis. Iâ€™m also a Teaching Assistant at Mount Holyoke College and have graded and tutored across calculus, statistics, and computer science courses.



### Current Role

Undergraduate Researcher 

- Mount Holyoke College Department of Mathematics & Statistics
- Collaborating with Professor Ben Pittman-Polletta on network-based statistical models
- EEG + mTRF analysis for speech perception (Python & MATLAB)
