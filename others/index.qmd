When I'm not doing math, I live a soft life.


## 📖 Writing
I love writing blogs and fan fictions in both Mandarin and English, where I pour my thoughts into tiny narratives.

## 🎨 Drawing  
Sketches, colors, midnight doodles — drawing is my way of tracing feeling.

## 📸 Photography  
I see people and other beautiful creatures through camera lens.

## 🧸 Life moments  
You’ll often find me curled up with a novel, journaling under fairy lights, or baking with friends.  
Here is where I keep a small archive of joy.  
🪴 Coming soon...
